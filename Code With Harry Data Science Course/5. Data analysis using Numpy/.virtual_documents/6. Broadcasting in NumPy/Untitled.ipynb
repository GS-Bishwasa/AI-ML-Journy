#Example: Looping Over Arrays in Python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = []

# Using a loop to square each element (slow)
for num in arr:
    result.append(num ** 2)

print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]





#Example: Vectorized Operation
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = arr ** 2  # Vectorized operation
print(result)  # Output: [1 4 9 16 25]








#Example: Broadcasting with Scalar
#Broadcasting is often used when you want to perform an operation on an array and a scalar value (e.g., add a number to all elements of an array).
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = arr + 10  # Broadcasting: 10 is added to all elements
print(result)  # Output: [11 12 13 14 15]





#Example: Broadcasting with Two Arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30])

result = arr1 + arr2  # Element-wise addition
print(result)  # Output: [11 22 33]


#Example: Broadcasting a 2D Array and a 1D Array
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
arr2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

result = arr1 + arr2  # Broadcasting arr2 across arr1
print(result)
# Output:
# [[2 4 6]
#  [5 7 9]]








#Example: Normalizing Data Using Broadcasting
#Imagine you have a dataset where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature. You can normalize the data by subtracting the mean of each column and dividing by the standard deviation.

# Simulating a dataset (5 samples, 3 features)
data = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
                 [15, 25, 35],
                 [20, 30, 40],
                 [25, 35, 45],
                 [30, 40, 50]])

# Calculating mean and standard deviation for each feature (column)
mean = data.mean(axis=0)
std = data.std(axis=0)

# Normalizing the data using broadcasting
normalized_data = (data - mean) / std

print(normalized_data)
