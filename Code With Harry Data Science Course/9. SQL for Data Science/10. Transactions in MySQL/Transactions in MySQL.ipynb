    "\n",
    "A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit. A transaction has four key properties, known as **ACID**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none are applied.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Guarantees the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Prevents transactions from interfering with each other.\n",
