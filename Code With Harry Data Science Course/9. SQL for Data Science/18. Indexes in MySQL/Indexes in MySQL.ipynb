    "## What is an Index in MySQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "An index in MySQL is a data structure that enhances the speed of data retrieval operations, particularly for queries involving `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or searches on large tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Think of an index as the index in a bookâ€”it allows MySQL to quickly locate relevant rows without scanning every row in the table."

    "## Why Use Indexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes provide the following benefits:\n",
    "- **Speed up queries**: Improve performance for searches, filters, and sorting operations.\n",
    "- **Frequent lookups**: Enhance efficiency for commonly queried columns.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Support efficient querying as the database grows."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Column Index\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an index on a single column, such as the `email` column in the `users` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: This creates a quick lookup structure for the `email` column, speeding up queries that filter or sort by email."

    "### 2. Multi-column (Composite) Index\n",
    "\n",
    "For queries that filter on multiple columns, such as `name` and `city`, you can create a composite index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_name_city ON users(name, city);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The order of columns matters. This index is most effective when queries filter on `name` and `city` in that order."

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP INDEX idx_email ON users;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: This removes the index named `idx_email` from the `users` table, freeing up space but potentially slowing down queries that relied on it."

    "## When to Use Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are beneficial in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- Columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses.\n",
    "- Queries involving unique fields like `email`, `username`, or `ID`.\n",
    "- Filtering large tables for specific values.\n",
    "- Improving performance of lookups and joins."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## When Not to Use Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid indexes in these cases:\n",
    "- Small tables where MySQL can quickly scan all rows.\n",
    "- Columns rarely used in searches or filtering.\n",
    "- Columns with low cardinality (few unique values, e.g., a `gender` field with only 'M' and 'F').\n",
    "- Tables with frequent inserts or updates, as indexes can slow down write operations."

    "## Viewing Existing Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "To list all indexes on a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW INDEX FROM users;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command displays all indexes defined on the `users` table, including their names and columns."

    "|------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Create index     | `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column);` |\n",
    "| Delete index     | `DROP INDEX idx_name ON table;`        |\n",

    "**Key Takeaway**: Indexes are powerful for improving query performance, but overusing them or indexing inappropriate columns can degrade performance. Analyze your query patterns to decide where indexes are needed."
